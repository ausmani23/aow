# What's Wrong with Mass Incarceration?

This repository contains the code that generates results and figures 'Abolition of What?' by Christopher Lewis and Adaner Usmani. To do more than browse the code (i.e., to replicate our results), you will need the source data. We do not store these on the Github, for proprietary and storage reasons. Contact Adaner for more information. 

All graphs and calculations (where indicated in the text) are replicated by aow.R. Further explanations are in the comments of the file itself.
